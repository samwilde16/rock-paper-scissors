# Rock, paper, scissors

A game of rock, paper, scissors to test my JS ability after getting up to speed. The aim here was to write clean code that worked well. 

The game works best with the console open, but I plan on adding an interface so the game can be played directly from the webpage without prompts and alerts (see issues)
